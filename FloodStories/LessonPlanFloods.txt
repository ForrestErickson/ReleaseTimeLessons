For Genesis 8 Google translated the Hebrew verse 21 
כא  וַיָּרַח יְהוָה, אֶת-רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ, וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה

To:
 "21 And Yahweh smelled the odor of the incense, and Yahweh said"

What does the JKV say in verse 21? 

In the Hebrew, the diety is named what?
In the KJV is the diety is called by a descriptive title, a job description, or a proper name?  
What is the word by which the diety is called?  
Does the KJV obsure the fact that the Hebrew bible called the diety by a proper name?

Note the user of plural versus singular for the dieity(s) in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the KJV. 
Referring to the assertions of the Documentary Hypothesis, who (which source) might have made the change and when from plural to singular for the diety?

This audio book covers not only the text of the epic but an introduction to the recovery of the epic from the library of Naive. 
Listening to this narration may be like the experience of an illiterate person in the presence of a master storyteller.

"The buried book : the loss and rediscovery of the great Epic of Gilgamesh" / David Damrosch.
Damrosch, David.
This book goes into great detail on the history of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the persons who recovered the story for us.
